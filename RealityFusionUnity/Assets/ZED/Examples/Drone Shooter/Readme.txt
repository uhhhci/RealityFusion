.....................IMPORTANT.....................
You must download either Oculus Integration plugin
Or SteamVR plugin (or both if you want to), for this demo to work with VR Controllers

The ZEDControllerTracker.cs is set by default to track the Right Controller.
You're gonna need to change that value if you want somehting else tracked.
