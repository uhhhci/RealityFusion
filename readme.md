## Reality Fusion
Robust Real-time Immersive Mobile Robot Teleoperation with Volumetric Visual Data Fusion

**Reality fusion** is a high performance and robust immersive robot teleoperation system that combines the best of both worlds: the high fidelity of neural rendering (3D Gaussian Splattings) and real-time stereoscopic point cloud projection.
